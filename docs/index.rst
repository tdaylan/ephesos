Introduction
----

A large fraction of light sources in the sky is time-variable. Their variability contains valuable information about their nature.

Ephesus photodynamically calculates the total brightness of a system of stars, compact objects, planets, and moons as a function of time. The stars can potentially have time-variability due to stellar magnetism in the form of spots, faculae, and flares. It can model photometric, radial velocity, and astrometric time-series data typically collected in astronomy.

Ephesus derives its name from the ancient city of Ephesus on the western coast of Anatolia.
